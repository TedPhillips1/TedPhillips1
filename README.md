# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Ted, a junior full-stack developer with a passion for making great things!
After a failed Shopify venture in my final year of uni (a Bsc in Biomedical Science at the University of Warwick) I realised that I don't want to flog cheap products from China, and if I really want to make a difference in the world I need to make something great that adds value to people's lives. Lacking an Engineering degree I sought the most accessible way of becoming an engineer and I stumbled into coding. I joined the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) and I haven't looked back since. I now have 3+ years of experience in full stack development and have developed strong platform engineering skills through my time in employment. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm 6'6", no, I don't play basketball, and yes, the weather is nice up here!
