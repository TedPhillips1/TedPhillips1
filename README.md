# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Ted, a junior full-stack developer with a passion for making great things!
After a failed shopify venture in my final year of uni (a Bsc in Biomedical Science at the University of Warwick) I realised that I don't want to flog cheap products from China and if I really want to make a difference in the world I need to make something great that adds value to people's lives. Lacking an Engineering degree I sought the easiest (not so easy now) way of becoming an engineer and I stumbled into coding. I joined the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) and I haven't looked back since!
